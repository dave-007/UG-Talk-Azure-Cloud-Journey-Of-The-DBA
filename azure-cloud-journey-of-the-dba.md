# Azure Cloud Journey of the DBA

## Big Picture

### Learning I.T. ,Cloud, Azure has changed, change with it

- Breadth over depth

- Focus on aspects common to multiple technologies

    - Cloud Building Blocks

        - Compute (VMs, Functions)

- Network

- Storage (Blob, Page, Block, Files, Queues &amp; Tables)

- Data

            - Relational/Structured

- Non-Relational/NoSQL

- RBAC

- Monitoring

- Identities

- SKUs

        - Trading features for cost

- Jack of (many) trades applies to cloud.

- What if I'm not an expert at anything, but choose to be a professional amateur?

- Effective individual learners make effective teams, and make effective companies

- I help companies us Azure, learn Azure, ask me to help you or your organization with your cloud learning plan. **This is my marketing.**

- In this crisis/opportunity, it will be difficult for those that do not choose to adapt. I want to adapt and help others too.

- I seek individuals and companies that want to embody these values (TODO: values). You are my next client.

- Start with the fundamentals

### Hands-On Tutorials & Walkthroughs



### Facing Fears

Contrasting my mindset from a year ago to today.

I felt like I was not good enough, my skills were expiring, overwhelmed by a future without the certainty of salary, unappreciated despite past efforts and successes, old and out of it.

Today I can look back on several small victories over the year, they give me evidence that I am worthy, I am growing, I am up to the challenges, and optimistic about the future in my work.

This gives me room to put myself out there, to risk, to offer wise advice. Is that moral authority?

Whether I communicate well or not, the fact that I can accomplish things in tech gives me confidence. Great thing about tech is there's no politics, no charisma that will make a script work. You know it and can solve it or you do not.

You will be here in a year, (Lord willing) having faced your fears and done the work or in the same situation. You will have to pay if you do the work, and you'll pay a different price if you don't



- Each certification exam

- Small business client I migrated into Azure

- Small business client I migrated to Azure SQL DB, P2S VPN

- MSB whose clients I helped with SQL & Azure

- Trainign companies whose students gave me 8+ of of 9 ratings for Azure fundamentals, administration, & Data Platform training

### My Story

Year ago, full time work, dabbling in cloud with some cool projects, thinking company was going there and I was in great position.

I was cut to 1 day a week and had to face my options

### WIIFM - What's In it for Me?

Being immersed in cloud learning has paid off. I am enjoying learning, I am comfortable solving problems that woudl have stopped me, I am inspired by the new tools and their evolutions.

“A man's mind is stretched by a new idea or sensation, and never shrinks back to its former dimensions.”

―**Oliver Wendell Holmes **

### Cloud Challenges for the DBA





- You are used to knowing it all (or at least knowing most) and being the expert on the database server, but cloud is so big and changing so rapidly you can't be at the knowledge comfort level you used to have,

    - Trade away expert for 'effective journeyman'.

- Professional learner

- Analogy is knowing your hometown, where all the good sub shops are, but when you start travelling you can't know them all, and it's not productive to try. Now you learn how to find that great sub shop (google map, etc)

        - Raise up your level of abstraction, wide &amp; shallow, then follow your curiosity on where to go deep.

### Certification Overload!

[About – CDMP](https://cdmp.info/about/)

### Sharing what you know





- You must have courage to make mistakes.

- I'll hide mistakes in this presentation and reward the finders. Share what you know with me.

- Sharing knowledge closes the loop on learning

- I'll survey during the presentation to engage, guide presentation focus, learn myself

### Life long learning





- Eliminating distractions is key to making focused time to learn and cross that barrier.

- Fear is the mindkiller, we lose our best capabilities when afraid, and I get afraid when I think about EVERYTHING I still don't know. Break it down to year, month, week, today.

- Learning consistently, daily is compound interest for the mind and life

- Learning in breadth is learning all the relevant components on a high level, then drilling down two or three layers

- Breadth learning is a big part of learning the cloud

- Depth learning is drilling into a few key components that interest you, that line up with your skillset.

- My depth is PowerShell, AZCLI, maybe IaC

- **Cloud Meta Learning** - Learning cloud reveals overlaps in every area, the more you learn, the easier the next this is to learn

    - RBAC

- Networking

- SKU levels

- PowerShell &amp; CLI

- You can't remember what it was like to not know things you now know, so you forget this uncertainty, this incompetent feeling. Any now you avoid it.

- It is difficult to explain the benefit or reward of knowing to one who hasn't travelled that path due to fear. They can't see the benefit, only the obstacle.

### Key Points



- Story from stuck and fearful to hopeful forward motion

- Career is learning, making, sharing with others

- Cloud is ultimately simple and rewarding to learn, especially for you the DBA, with the right ingredients

    - Continuous improvement in process (habits)

- Know and exploit (maximize) the learning resources out there

- Be a resource to someone else to complete the learning loop

- Cert paths for cloud data

    - Fundamentals

- Admin

- Data Platform Engineer

- Data Administrator

- Data Engineer

- Data Analyst

- 

### Focus is a superpower




- “It's easier to hold your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold them 98 percent of the time.”

- - Clayton M. Christensen


- ― Oliver Wendell Holme

- This moment in time, with the internet we have unlimited options on what to do with our time

    - Discourse

        - Happy conversations

- Angry conversations

- Consume streaming media 

        - Entertain

- Learn

- Read

        - Quality

- Titilation

- Unfiltered, we all roll downhill to the lest common denominator (Idiocracy)

- **Creating and continually refining our filter turns this around. We now have access to the very best ideas, teachers, inspirations.**

-  We have the best mentors. We can be more, be our best.

- Over time, as we choose the best inputs, we produce the best outputs.

- Best ideas:

    - Atomic Habits

        - Exercise

- Mindfulness, Meditation

- Deep Work

- Laying aside bad habits as we integrate good ones ( not so hard as before, now they are like shoes that no longer fit)

- Bad Habits are just Obsolete ideas

    - Addictions

- Non-optimal relationships

- Non-optimal work

- Each sacrifice of the obsolete makes more room to apply the best ideas in your life.

- It is easier to fully commit than to dabble. 

- “It's easier to hold your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold them 98 percent of the time.” - Clayton M Christensen
