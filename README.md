### Abstract:
> DBAs losing their jobs to the cloud? WRONG! You are all about data, and so is the cloud! As the database administrator, you have a unique skill set that maps effectively to the cloud and gives you a jump start on learning the skills for the most interesting and in-demand cloud roles.
> Coming from a DBA role into learning and working in the cloud has been a challenging but rewarding journey. I'll share what I've learned, explain the most promising learning and career paths for data professionals in the cloud, and help you plan your own cloud journey of the DBA.
